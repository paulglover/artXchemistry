    <h2 id="artist-statement">Artist Statement</h2>

<p>Film photography is the place where art meets chemistry (and science in general). I use a variety of optical machines (works of physics and engineering) to capture the beauty of the world around me onto film, which is itself a marvel of chemistry. The end result is an image on a physical medium, a very real artifact you can hold and look at. A piece of art, if I’ve held up my end of the process as best I can.</p>

<p>There’s a place for digital capture in my life also, but with the rise of photoshoppery, overly post-processed images, software-for-rent and now AI generated images, isn’t it something to be able to look at the film which was right there in camera at the moment of exposure and know that everything derived from it is as real as it can be?</p>

<p>I know… there’s still a digital step to get the image onto this website. That can’t be helped. But I keep processing to a minimum after the scan; you can draw a direct line from the end image back to that exposure in the camera.</p>

<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>

<p>I was born in Lisburn, Northern Ireland quite some time ago. In 2005 I moved to Virginia, USA and I now am based out of the New River Valley region.</p>

<h2 id="technical">Technical</h2>

<p>I shoot with all manner of photo gear, but this site is dedicated to my work in analog (i.e. film) media.</p>

<h3 id="cameras">Cameras</h3>

<h4 id="sinar-f">Sinar F</h4>

<p>The <strong>Sinar F</strong> monorail view camera is a workhorse of the industry. “F” stands for “field” as in, it is supposedly suitable for use out in the field. This is… a stretch, maybe, but I’ve certainly proven it to be possible, and I’m by no means alone (there’s a photo out there of Kenny Rogers, who was less well-known for his apparently excellent photography skills than his musical talents, using a Sinar F for some kind of landscape detail shot).</p>

<p>My particular example is a quite beaten up one, bought for a song on eBay. It looks like it was dragged backward through a hedgerow, but everything aligns where it needs to and locks down properly, and the light-tight parts are indeed light-tight. I’ve added some extra parts (Sinars are famously modular) to make shooting it a little better, but it’s never going to be anything but a rough example.</p>

<p><em>Q: How do I double the value of my Sinar F? A: Insert a film holder with two sheets loaded!</em></p>

<p>I have to admit, there’s something which appeals to me about using a camera that looks like it came out of a dumpster to make images which blow away the output from multi-thousand-dollar digital systems.</p>

<h4 id="yashica-a">Yashica A</h4>

<p>The <strong>Yashica A</strong> is a bare-bones twin-lens reflex camera which shoots square 6x6 frames on 120 film. It has an 80mm f/3.5 taking lens and few frills.</p>

<p>According to the serial number, my example was built in June of 1962. It works like new, but since there’s almost nothing to go wrong beyond the reliable Copal shutter, that’s hardly a surprise.</p>

<p>It regularly punches above its meager weight in the imagery department.</p>
